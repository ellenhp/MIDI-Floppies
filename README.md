MIDI-Floppies
=============

Currently this project is non-functional, but it aims to let users control floppy drives with a MIDI keyboard plugged directly into an Arduino, expanding on what Moppy currently allows.

In the future, standalone use may be possible, but use as a MIDI instrument is the primary goal.
